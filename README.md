# SaathiCare

**Comprehensive Alzheimer's care management platform** built for patients, guardians, and caretakers.

SaathiCare provides a unified ecosystem that adapts content and interaction complexity based on the patient's cognitive stage (early / moderate / severe). It includes AI-powered companion chat, cognitive games, memory-room therapy, daily scheduling, medication tracking, and a QR-based Good Samaritan system for patient safety.
